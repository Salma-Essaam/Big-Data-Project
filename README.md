# Bitcoin Data Analysis (Big Data Project)

This project focuses on analyzing large-scale Bitcoin transaction data using Big Data tools.  
A pipeline was created with **PySpark** to preprocess and analyze the data efficiently.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of Bitcoin transactions  
- Transformation and normalization of large-scale datasets  
- Distributed processing using **PySpark**  

## Technologies 
- PySpark  
- Big Data Processing  

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is too large to include in this repository.  
You can download Bitcoin transaction data from sources like:  
- Kaggle Bitcoin Datasets: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
 

## How to Run
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
